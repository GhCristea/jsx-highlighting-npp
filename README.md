#JSX Syntax Highlighting for Notepad++
For those times when you need to edit JSX files inside of Notepad++. 
Patterned after the default javascript version, this adds some, (admittedly), simple highlighting for the HTML as well. 
However, while a bit simple, it is still just good enough to be useful for me - and hopefully good enough for you as well.
 

#Installation
In Notepad++ go to Language -> Define your Language... -> Import.  Then, import *jsx.xml* from this repo.

#Limitations
Here are some known limitations:
- Code folding seems to be broken
- Matching angle brackets not highlighted
- No highlighting for regexes
