#JSX Syntax Highlighting for Notepad++
For those times when you need to edit JSX files inside of Notepad++. 
Patterned after the default javascript version, this adds some, (admittedly simple), highlighting for the HTML as well. 
However, while a bit simple, it is still *just good enough* to be useful for me - and maybe useful for you as well.
 
#Example

#Installation
In Notepad++ go to Language -> Define your Language... -> Import,  and choose the *jsx.xml* file from this repo.  This should place the JSX language at the bottom of the list of languages.

#Limitations
Here are some known limitations:
- Code folding seems to be broken
- Matching angle brackets not highlighted
- No highlighting for regexes
